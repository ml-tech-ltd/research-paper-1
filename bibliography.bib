abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new architecture to study artificial stock markets. This architecture rests on a mechanism called 'school' which is a procedure to map the phenotype to the genotype or, in plain English, to uncover the secret of success. We propose an agent-based model of 'school', and consider school as an evolving population driven by single-population GP (SGP). The architecture also takes into consideration traders' search behavior. By simulated annealing, traders' search density can be connected to psychological factors, such as peer pressure or economic factors such as the standard of living. This market architecture was then implemented in a standard artificial stock market. Our econometric study of the resultant artificial time series evidences that the return series is independently and identically distributed (iid), and hence supports the efficient market hypothesis (EMH). What is interesting though is that this iid series was generated by traders, who do not believe in the EMH at all. In fact, our study indicates that many of our traders were able to find useful signals quite often from business school, even though these signals were short-lived. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {With the demand for knowledge-handling systems capable of dealing with and distinguishing between various facets of imprecision ever increasing, a clear and formal characterization of the mathematical models implementing such services is quintessential. In this paper, this task is undertaken simultaneously for the definition of implication within two settings: first, within intuitionistic fuzzy set theory and secondly, within interval-valued fuzzy set theory. By tracing these models back to the underlying lattice that they are defined on, on one hand we keep up with an important tradition of using algebraic structures for developing logical calculi (e.g. residuated lattices and MV algebras), and on the other hand we are able to expose in a clear manner the two models' formal equivalence. This equivalence, all too often neglected in literature, we exploit to construct operators extending the notions of classical and fuzzy implication on these structures; to initiate a meaningful classification framework for the resulting operators, based on logical and extra-logical criteria imposed on them; and finally, to re(de)fine the intuititive ideas giving rise to both approaches as models of imprecision and apply them in a practical context. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. The software presented in this paper is an implementation of an intuitionistic fuzzy inference system. Such type of fuzzy inference systems provide an extra layer of uncertainty, called indeterminacy, that the user can integrate in the antecedents and consequents of the fuzzy system. The additional calculations required to make an inference in this type of system needs a negligible extra amount of computational resources, making it a low-cost alternative to type-2 fuzzy inference systems. At the current time, no other implementation of such type of system exist that is open source and free of charge. The software is developed in Clojure in order to leverage the Java libraries, the JVM itself, and the capabilities of the programming language to implement concurrency in a convenient manner. However, the goal of this implementation is to provide a language-agnostic interface based in a REST API, which can be used by any programming language capable of handling HTTP requests. A comparison between a traditional type-1 fuzzy inference is provided, where the reader can observe how the indeterminacy affects the outputs of the system.},

Previous work using genetic algorithms has focused on the development of rule sets or high performance membership functions; however, the interdependence between these two components suggests a simultaneous design procedure would be a more appropriate methodology. When GA's have been used to develop both, it has been done serially, e.g., design the membership functions and then use them in the design of the rule set. This, however, means that the membership functions were optimized for the initial rule set and not the rule set designed subsequently. GA's are fully capable of creating complete fuzzy controllers given the equations of motion of the system, eliminating the need for human input in the design loop. This new method has been applied to two problems, a cart controller and a truck controller. Beyond the development of these controllers, we also examine the design of a robust controller for the cart problem and its ability to overcome faulty rules},

This paper describes the application of a hierarchical coevolutionary fuzzy system called HiCEFS for predicting financial time series. A novel financial trading system using HiCEFS as a predictive model and employing a prudent trading strategy based on the price percentage oscillator (PPO) is proposed. In order to construct an accurate predictive model, a form of generic membership function named irregular shaped membership function (ISMF) is employed and a hierarchical coevolutionary genetic algorithm (HCGA) is adopted to automatically derive the ISMFs for each input feature in HiCEFS. With the accurate prediction from HiCEFS and the prudent trading strategy, the proposed system outperforms the simple buy-and-hold strategy, the trading system without prediction and the trading system with other predictive models (EFuNN, DENFIS and RSPOP) on real-world financial data.},

abstract = {This article explores why agent oriented approaches are well suited for developing complex distributed systems, like in a range of telecommunication, commercial, and industrial applications. If agents have to enter the mainstream of software engineering it is vital that clear arguments are advanced as to their suitability for solving large classes of problems. It is shown how agent oriented approaches apply in a specific telecommunication application. In making these arguments, it is possible for proponents of other software engineering paradigms to claim that the key concepts of agent-oriented computing can be reproduced using their technique. Agent-oriented systems are, after all, computer programs and all programs have the same set of computable functions. However, this misses the point. The value of a paradigm is the mindset and techniques it provides to software engineers. In this respect, agent-oriented concepts and techniques are both well suited to developing complex, distributed systems and an extension of those currently available in other paradigms.

Our results include the identification of the largest cluster based on keywords, the timeline of publication of index terms, the core journals and key subject categories. We also identify the core authors, top countries of origin of the manuscripts along with core research institutes.

There are more than 100 indicators used in practice today to understand the market behavior. Identification of the right combination of indicators for optimal portfolio performance has always been a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a supervised learning approach to generate trading signals (buy / sell) using a combination of technical indicators. Proposed system uses a genetic algorithm along with principle component analysis to identify a subset of technical indicators which detect rise and fall of the market with greater accuracy and generates realistic trading signals. The performance of this new algorithm was tested using trading data obtained from National Stock Exchange (NSE), India. Simulation shows the enhanced profitability for the proposed trading strategy},

abstract = {Intuitionistic fuzzy set, characterized by a membership function and a non-membership function, was introduced by Atanassov [Intuitionistic fuzzy sets, Fuzzy Sets and Systems 20 (1986) 87-96]. In this paper, we define the concepts of intuitionistic preference relation, consistent intuitionistic preference relation, incomplete intuitionistic preference relation and acceptable intuitionistic preference relation, and study their various properties. We develop an approach to group decision making based on intuitionistic preference relations and an approach to group decision making based on incomplete intuitionistic preference relations respectively, in which the intuitionistic fuzzy arithmetic averaging operator and intuitionistic fuzzy weighted arithmetic averaging operator are used to aggregate intuitionistic preference information, and the score function and accuracy function are applied to the ranking and selection of alternatives. Finally, a practical example is provided to illustrate the developed approaches. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},
